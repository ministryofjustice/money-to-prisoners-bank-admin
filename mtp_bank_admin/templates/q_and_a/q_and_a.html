		<li>the prisoner has left prison</li>

	<p>Try to generate the reference.<br> If the reference can’t be generated, check with the prisoner that you have their correct date of birth and correct prisoner number.<br>Sometimes the date of birth is entered incorrectly into the prison system.<br>The prisoner might need to ask an officer on the wing to check it and let you know.</p><br>

	<h1 class="heading-medium no-space-under-heading">11. How do I get my money back if I made a bank transfer in-branch or by international transfer?</h1>
